1 - this HW is running clustering model on census data and applying it to see the correlationship.

2- I worked this HW with Lan

3 - We write the code together and revise it together. Both of us have participated in each step.

Note 
- Although the due date has been over, I do the rest of the homework to learn the coding and resubmit it as the second notebook. 
- The second notebook(after the first notebook) is prepared by myself.
