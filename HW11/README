1 - this HW is running clustering model on census data and applying it to see the correlationship.

2- I worked this HW with Lan

3 - We write the code together and revise it together. Both of us have participated in each step.

Note 
- The first notebook is submitted before the duedate. 
- Although the duedate is over, I was enthusiastic to learn the coding so I do the rest of the homework. The second notebook (after the first notebook)is all prepared by myself.
