1 - this HW is running clustering model on census data and applying it to see the correlationship.

2- I worked this HW with Lan

3 - We write the code together and revise it together. Both of us have participated in each step.

Note 
- The first notebook is submitted before the due date. 
- Although the due date has been over, I did the rest of the homework to learn the coding and therefore I got the result of KMean clustering. 
- The second notebook(after the first notebook) is all prepared by myself (Kay).
