1 - What the homework was about in your own words

This homework is making plots and show visualization learned in the class. 
My topic of the assignment is from the research project "An Analysis on the Flood Risk and Socioeconomic-Demographic Status" 
The data is based on Wilmington, Delaware.

Fig1. Flood Depth Grid Subtitle is the one percent annual chance flood in coastal New Castle County (Unit: Feet). Flood hazard is defined by a relation between depth of flooding and the annual chance of inundation greater than that depth. Depth grid is defined by the percent annual chance floods. This is usually only the 1% annual chance flood.This figure is based on the raster data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in 2014, which is the most recent available data in Delaware.

**Fig 2. Census Block Groups** Subtitle is the census block groups in New Castle County. This figure is based on 2010 shapefile. Please note that the most recent data is 2016 but this figure is based on 2010 data to align with the other available data in this research.

**Fig 3 Socioeconomic demographic (SED) status** Subtitle is the socioeconomic demographic status in New Castle County. The data is estimated from 2014 to 2018 and the data source is from the U.S. Census Bureau. In this figure, the mean of the median household income is $6,7356, the mean of the percentage of not white people is 33.7%, and the rate of the total percentage of poverty is 9.2%.

**Fig 4. Flood Depth Grid with Latitude and Longitude** Subtitle is the 1% Annual Flood Depth Grid in Coastal Area, Wilmington, Delaware (Unit:Feet). The data is based on the 2014 raster data from the FEMA. The figure above shows the 1% annual flood depth grid clipped from 0 to 1. The figure shows that the local area surrounded by the Delaware River has the flood risk.

**Fig 5. Flood depth and SED results** Subtitle is the 1% Annual Flood Depth Grid and Socioeconomic Demographic Status in Coastal Area, Wilmington, Delaware. The figure above shows the urban area around the Delaware River in the city is exposed to the 1% annual flood risk. This area is surrounded by the minority who are under average medeian household income, not white, and below povert line.
