1 - What the homework was about in your own words

This homework is about "Iceptionism" using Convolutional Neural Networks in images. 
The results show how to generate Deep Dream (with Caffe) images from user-supplied photos using Google's pretrained Inception neural network. 
This techinique gives sense of the level of abstraction that a layer has achived in its understanding of images.
