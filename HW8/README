1 - What the homework was about in your own words

The homework 8 is following the paper "Examining the feasibility of using open data to benchmark building energy usage in cities: A data science and policy perspective" (Roth et al, 2019).
In this homework, I chose two cities as London and Washington DC and conduct the Random Forest Regressor to find out the important features. 

2 - Who you worked with

Lan
 
3 - What things were you responsible

All the data coding and plotting 
(Lan and I discuss together about the data selection and data preprocessing and support each others when we have problems. 
Although the result is different since we preprocess the dataframes by ourselves, the data sources and the process of analysis are basically same.)
