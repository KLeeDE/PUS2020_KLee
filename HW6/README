1 - What the homework was about in your own words

The homework 6 contains solutions for HW5 and the new data analysis with regards to exploratory geospatial analysis. 
This homework is based on democratic and republicans voter turnout. 
I plotted the geospatial analysis results on the Delaware map, create the rook and queens weights for the DE electoral map geoDF, make a connection plot, 
create the spatial lag metrics and calculate the global Moran's I.

2 - Who you worked with

I do it by myself (P.S. discuss the result with Lan)
 
3 - What things were you responsible

All the data coding and plotting
