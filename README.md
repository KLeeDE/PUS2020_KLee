# PUS2020_KLee

My name is Kyungmin Lee (I usually go by Kay informally). I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Energy and Environmental Policy (ENEP) program at the University of Delaware. I got a master degree in Environmental planning and a bachelor degree in Economics. My background is mostly related to energy and environmental policy issues. 

I expect to learn data science methodology including statistics and machine learning focusing on time series and geospatial analysis. I am planning to apply the methodology in multiple environmental contexts and expand research idea on developing evidence-based policy.
